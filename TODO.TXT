** record level scripts
    **  r-insert

*** problem in db level scripts : not checking if the user entered an empty db name. (after command:  read -p "db-drop: Enter DB name: " db_name)

****  write a function get_config_info that is used by all scripts to read scripts/config file 
        -----> made a script " ./scripts/config  that is intended to be sourced
                into every script but it needs more work so 
                (( Postponed )) 2023_04_01

    -re print the menu after every input 
    -exit with code 0 and put it last
